#Aim
Ths aim of this project is to get an introduction to computational thermodynamics. 
#Introduction
Honestly I chose this projecct becuase of personal interest
I believe that I can further strengten my understanding of the concepts of thermodynamics and thermochemistry better by trying to make a simulation that mimicks these natural systems

Whta I am trying to do here comes under the concept of simulating natural systems. The thermodynamic system is one of them. Other ones might include quantum, thermokinetics, molecular dynamics, force fields, weather and shit

There are multiple ways of simulating this sytstem
Explain general idea of simulation
There is using forces
    problem being local minima
There is using monte carlo methods
    explain it's pros and cons

#Methods
Show and explain code and implementation

#Results
gifs of particles up to 40

#Discussion
indicate optimization, change to numpy, vectorization of code, usage of git version control, computation speed and memory usage
Issues'

#Conclusion
